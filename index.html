                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Tatev Monastery is located in South-East Armenia, in the area of ancient Armenian Syunik, not far from the city of Goris and 280 km away from Yerevan. The Tatev plateau has been in use since pre-Christian times, hosting a pagan temple. The temple was replaced with a modest church following the Christianization of Armenia in the 4th century.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Tatev is known as the bishopric seat of Syunik and played a significant role in the history of the region as a center of economic, political, spiritual and cultural activity.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The Monastery of Tatev has been described as one of the two best-known monasteries in Armenia, along with Noravank in the province of Vayots Dzor. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the monastery hosted one of the most important Armenian medieval universities, the University of Tatev, which contributed to the advancement of science, religion and philosophy, reproduction of books and development of miniature painting. Scholars of the Tatev University contributed to the preservation of Armenian culture and creed during one of its most turbulent periods in its history.</p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5"> Restoration and New Life</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The restoration of the monastery, re-establishing its educational legacy and reviving monastic life at Tatev is one of the main goals of Tatev Revival Program, a part of which is the Wings of Tatev aerial tramway, a cableway from Tatev to the village of Halidzor, which was opened in October 2010. It was included in the Guinness World Records as world's "longest non-stop double track cable car."</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In 1995, the monasteries of Tatev, Tatevi Anapat and their adjacent areas of the Vorotan Valley were added to the tentative list of World Heritage Sites of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).</p>

                                        Believe me when I say that you have never seen anything like this majestic monastery. It is one of those rare places on this planet where you can connect with God or at least have some piece and quiet.

                                                I tried the cable car. It was like flying over the mountains. It is indeed very long and a bit scary. But I'd say it is worth trying.

                                        OMG, the cable car was really scary but the experience was fantastic. I'll send you all the pictures I took later. I still need to sort them out.
